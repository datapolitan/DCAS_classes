This repository contains outlines for [analytics courses](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/employees/learning_ctc_home.shtml) taught under contract with the New York City [Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/home/home.shtml) to New York City employees.

Courses run either all day (7 hours with a 1 hour lunch break) or half day (3 hours). Every class is run with 50 minute blocks of interactive lecture, discussion, and exercises, with a 10 minute break, except the half-day course, which runs in two blocks, with a 10 minute break between. This helps keep the class dynamic and allows the students time to absorb the material. 

The courses are:
+ [Introduction to Open Data](Introduction_Open_Data.md)
+ [Data Analytics for Managers](Data_Analytics_for_Managers.md)
+ [Excel Tools: Summarizing Data](Excel_Tools_Summarizing_Data.md)
+ [Introduction to Statistical Analysis](Introduction_Statistical_Analysis.md)
+ [Introduction to Open-Source Mapping with QGIS](Introduction_Open_Source_Mapping_with_QGIS.md)
