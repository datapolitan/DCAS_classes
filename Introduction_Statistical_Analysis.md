#Introduction to Statistical Analysis

##Summary
A one-day course covering the basis of descriptive statistics with open data, including basic statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and variance. The course also covers correlation, linear regression, and introduces decision modeling using open data.

##Target Audience
Employees of all levels who perform data analysis and communicate analytical findings in support city operations.

##Course Outline
This course introduces participants to the use of statistics for understanding and communicating city data. Using Excel, participants will learn how to use measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance interval to understand the content of city data for making operational decisions. Participants will also learn how to display statistical information in meaningful ways.

##Goals
+ Learn common statistical measures, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance
+ Calculate correlation coefficients for bivariate data and apply the technique of simple regression analysis
+ Demonstrate techniques used for forecasting
+ Communicate data meaningfully to a broad audience using charts and graphs in Microsoft Excel

##Key Takeaways
+ Participants will be familiar with common statistical measures
+ Participants will be able to calculate correlation coefficients for bivariate data and perform simple linear regression analysis
+ Participants will be familiar with the basic techniques of forecasting
+ Participants will be better able to communicate analysis using charts and graphs in Microsoft Excel
